Availability of quality data in ULIP integrating various data sets such as LDB of NICDC, FOIS of Indian Railways, Vahan Saarthi of MORTH, ICEGATE of Customs Department, FASTag of NPCI etc opens a plethora of opportunities and use-cases for increasing efficiency.

One such use case can be finding the most appropriate mix of the fleet, and the most optimal route. With the help of ULIP Data and AI-driven route optimisation solutions, a Zardozi Saree manufacturer in Bareilly and exporting sarees to Berlin can accurately choose the shortest, most efficient, and most cost-effective routes suiting his requirements.

As of today, there is not much visibility about the predictive freight rate trend, supply-demand gaps, truck utilisation factors, corridor congestion data etc. Combining ULIP Data with AI and ML tools can lead to a prediction of trends and evidence-based intervention can be done both by government and private entities.

The Indian logistics industry is still largely disorganised and fragmented and suffers from a skewed intermodal mix. For instance, in 2020, Rail’s share stood at merely 18 per cent as compared to Road’s share of 71 per cent. In India, the average lead of freight transport is around 550 km, and for such long-haul transport on dense corridors, Rail transport is economical and environment friendly.
